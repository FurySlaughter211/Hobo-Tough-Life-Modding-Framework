Hi Guys in this guide I´ll do my best to help you install the Plugin
that makes modding possible for Hobo: Tough Life

Step 1: Install BepinEx

BepInEx is the mod loader/code injector that makes modding this game
possible.

1\. Download \*\*BepInEx 6 IL2CPP\*\* from:

  https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be

2\. Download the \*\*Unity IL2CPP\*\* version (Windows x64)

  (You´ll find it under Artifacts.)

3\. After the download is complete you have to extract the ZIP into your
game folder:

  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Hobo Tough Life\\

  If youre not comfortable with copying the files around you can also:

 

  1. Press Windows + R

  2. type cmd (this will open your terminal)

  3. A black box should appear

  4. If the ZIP file is currently in downloads you can copy paste this:
cd Downloads

  If its not just replace Downloads with the name of the current
location

  5. Then copy paste this while keeping the quotation marks as shown and
replacing the \[variable\] with the filename: tar -xf "\[variable\].zip"
-C "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Hobo Tough Life"

  If you dont have the game over steam just replace the path with your
own game path

 

 

 

4\. Your game folder should now have a `BepInEx` folder

5\. Now run the game ones and close it (If a black box pops up its
working) This will make BepinEx create necessary files

Step 2: Set up my HoboModFramework

1.In the same folder as this README.txt should be a file called
HoboModPlugin.dll (That is the little guy that does the magic)

2\. Copy it to:

  \`\`\`

  \[Game Folder\]\\BepInEx\\plugins\\HoboModPlugin.dll

  \`\`\`

Step 3:

1.  Createa ´HoboMods´ folder:

2.Download mods and place each in its own folder:

  \`\`\`

  \[Game Folder\]\\BepInEx\\plugins\\HoboMods\\

  \`\`\`

So: HoboMods\\

  ├── CoolItemsMod\\

  │ ├── mod.json (Yes this thingy is AI generated no clue how to type it
myself lol)

  │ ├── items\\

  │ └── recipes\\

  └── AnotherMod\\

  └── ...

3\. Start the game and the mods should load automatically

If anything doesn´t work or you don´t understand something you can come
and ask in the Discord I set up: https://discord.gg/ebHwpKNVsa

Also if you want to uninstall this because its still a work in progress
and might be really buggy ( sorry ): 1.Delete the BepinEx folder from
your game folder

2.Verify game files through Steam
