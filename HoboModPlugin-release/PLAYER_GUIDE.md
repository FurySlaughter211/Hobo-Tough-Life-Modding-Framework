Hi Guys in this guide I'll do my best to help you install the Plugin that makes modding possible for Hobo: Tough Life




Step 1: Install BepInEx


BepInEx is the mod loader/code injector that makes modding this game possible.


1. Download **BepInEx 6 IL2CPP** from:
   https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be


2. Download the **Unity IL2CPP** version (Windows x64)
   (You'll find it under Artifacts.)


3. After the download is complete you have to extract the ZIP into your game folder:

   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hobo Tough Life\

   If you're not comfortable with copying the files around you can also:

   1. Press Windows + R
   2. Type cmd (this will open your terminal)
   3. A black box should appear
   4. If the ZIP file is currently in downloads you can copy paste this: cd Downloads
      If it's not just replace Downloads with the name of the current location
   5. Then copy paste this while keeping the quotation marks as shown and replacing the [variable] with the filename:
      tar -xf "[variable].zip" -C "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hobo Tough Life"

      If you don't have the game over Steam just replace the path with your own game path


4. Your game folder should now have a BepInEx folder


5. Now run the game once and close it (If a black box pops up it's working)
   This will make BepInEx create necessary files


Step 2: Set up my HoboModFramework


1. In the same folder as this PLAYER_GUIDE.md should be a file called HoboModPlugin.dll (That is the little guy that does the magic)
2. Do the same for Newtonsoft.Json.dll
   Also dont worry about the other files in the folder they are just for the development process of the mods   


3. Copy it to:

   [Game Folder]\BepInEx\plugins\HoboModPlugin.dll




Step 3: Install Mods


1. Create a 'HoboMods' folder:


2. Download mods and place each in its own folder:

   [Game Folder]\BepInEx\plugins\HoboMods\


So:   HoboMods\
      ├── CoolItemsMod\
      │   ├── mod.json   
      │   ├── items\
      │   └── recipes\
      └── AnotherMod\
          └── ...


(Yes this thingy is AI generated no clue how to type it myself lol)

3. Start the game and the mods should load automatically

If anything doesn't work or you don't understand something you can come and ask in the Discord I set up: https://discord.gg/ebHwpKNVsa



Also if you want to uninstall this because it's still a work in progress and might be really buggy (sorry):
1. Delete the BepInEx folder from your game folder
2. Verify game files through Steam
